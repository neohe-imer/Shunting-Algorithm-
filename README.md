# Shunting-Algorithm-
A Shunting-Algorithm  in Python using basic Arithmetic Operators like '*' '+' '-' '/'

Arithmetic Expression Evaluator (Shunting Yard Algorithm)

This project demonstrates how to convert an infix arithmetic expression (e.g., 1 + 4 * 2 - 5) into postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) using the Shunting Yard Algorithm, and then evaluate the postfix expression to get the final result.
