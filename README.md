# Arithmetic Expression Evaluator  
**Powered by the Shunting Yard Algorithm**  

This project implements the **Shunting Yard Algorithm** in Python to evaluate arithmetic expressions. It demonstrates how to:  

1. **Convert** an infix expression (e.g., `1 + 4 * 2 - 5`) into **postfix notation** (Reverse Polish Notation).  
2. **Evaluate** the postfix expression to compute the final result.

### âœ¨ Features  
- Supports the basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.  
- Demonstrates both **parsing** and **evaluation** stages.  
- Written in **pure Python** with no external dependencies.
